# 👨‍💻 Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity and technology portfolio — a collection of hands-on projects that showcase my passion for solving problems, securing systems, and continuously learning. Each project reflects real-world concepts and skills I've developed as I work toward a career in Identity & Access Management (IAM), Vulnerability Management, and Security Operations.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in **Computing and Security Technology** at **Drexel University**, with a strong academic foundation (GPA 3.98). I hold the **CompTIA Network+** certification and am preparing for the **Security+** exam.

With a background in technical support, I’ve spent the past few years gaining hands-on experience while transitioning into cybersecurity. My interests lie in **IAM**, **Cloud Security**, **Vulnerability Management**, and **Security Operations**, and I’m building this portfolio to showcase my capabilities through labs, research, and self-guided projects.
