# 👨‍💻 Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity and technology portfolio — a collection of hands-on projects that showcase my passion for solving problems, securing systems, and continuously learning. Each project reflects real-world concepts and skills I've developed as I work toward a career in Identity & Access Management (IAM), Vulnerability Management, and Security Operations.

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in IT Auditing & Cybersecurity at Temple University, having recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computing and Security Technology from Drexel University with a 3.95 GPA. I hold the CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications.

With hands-on experience in technical support, system operations, and security monitoring, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both Windows and Linux environments. My interests include Identity & Access Management (IAM), Security Operations, Vulnerability Management, and Cloud Security, and I use this portfolio to showcase real-world projects, research, and automation work aligned with those domains.
